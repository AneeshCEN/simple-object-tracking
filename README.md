simple-object-tracking
======================

Developed a supervised tracking system based on Particle Filter and Multiple Instance 
Learning (MIL) 

the orignal MIL code refer to http://vision.ucsd.edu/~bbabenko/project_miltrack.shtml

My Work:           
Used Particle filter as the sample method to find the best observation from the 
candidate prediction. 
Updated the appearance model by online MIL.  
Haar-like feature was used as the weak classifier in the process 

the experimental analysis using matlab is also included in this project
